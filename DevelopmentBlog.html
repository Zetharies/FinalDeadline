                     <p>Our current focus is on the MVP showcase which consists of a live demonstration of our game and requires a working website with the blog. The goals we set for this was to create and polish up our website, implement the developer’s blog alongside the home page, implement the critics and our mentor’s feedback on the game and to continue to create our game. This meant including voiceover’s for our main characters, pop-up text with the dialogue and also programming the zombie sprites to appear randomly onto our maps. In addition to this we focused on polishing up on certain aspects of the game, such as the map and menu page to give the game a more professional and finished look. We carried out these goals by delegating tasks to each team member so the tasks could be spread out and completed to the best of our ability. By doing this, it meant we had less of a rush and could improve on our work if need be. It was then decided who wanted to present and speak at the showcase and they carried out a separate meeting regarding the script and the presentation layout while the rest of the team cracked on with the work.

                     <p>
                       The next milestone of our game is the hack! The hack is meant to give a rough idea of what the game will look like according to the pitch we created for our previous submission. Our hack is being assessed in two ways; the source code and a screencast of our game.<br> Our interpretation of the screencast consisted using voiceover to demonstrate our sprites and the map we created.
                       The hack also consisted of creating a project plan which would document each team member’s role, a list of milestones and deadlines and what external factors may delay the project and a description of the system’s architecture. In order to create the project plan, we had a meeting so we sorted out everyone’s roles and how they would interact and communicate. <br> We then decided to work on the system architecture description as we agreed that this is the most challenging to write about as we were not sure how to approach this. We decided to use a C4 model architecture to demonstrate this after conducting some research and divided up the work so each team member had a task to complete; whether it would be the screencast or the project plan.

                       Welcome to the Final Dead-Line Development Blog, which will be updated with the development of our game and how the team is progressing.
                       We decided to use libGDX to build our zombie-survival themed adventure game! The premise of the game is a zombie outbreak in a university where the player must complete tasks and puzzles to progress to the next level and save the university from the zombies! The decision of creating a zombie game was discussed and agreed upon in our first meeting and the next few meetings consisted of creating a name for our game and an initial story for the zombie game and how it would link to a university.
                       We then decided to split the group into a technical team and a non-technical team. The technical team would focus on creating the initial foundations of the game while the non-technical team would focus on the storyline of the game and write the script.
