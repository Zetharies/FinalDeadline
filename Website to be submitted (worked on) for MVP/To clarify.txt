Personally, I'd use atom to make this.

Most of the CSS, pretty much all of the JS and the webfonts are from an external source. I need to reference that source but 
it's based on a game website template I found.

Basically what I need help with is organising/clearing up the code because it's **confusing** enough (for me anyway) as it is.
We might need to add some of our own JS in. but the main focus is putting the download functionality in bc that'll take the most time. I just got the webpage
as a whole started.
